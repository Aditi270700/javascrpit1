// what are the difference between var,let and const?
// Answer:- varaiable is a memory to store data
// var:-  var creates a function scope variable.
// let:- let create a block scope variable.
// const:- const can be assign value only once, its value cannot be changed.

// let keyword
// declare variable with let keyword

// var firstName = "Aditi";
// var firstName = "riya";
// console.log(firstName);

// block scope vs function scope (covered later in this )

let firstName = "Aditi";
firstName = "riya";
console.log(firstName);

// let is not declare many times but var is declared, 
// this is the diffrence between var and let

// declare Constants
// what is constant, it is not change

const pi = 3.14;
console.log(pi);
console.log(pi * 2 * 2);
